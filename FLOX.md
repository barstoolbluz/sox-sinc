# Flox Environment Creation Quick Guide

## 0 Persona
- Be rigorous and disciplined in your analysis. Favor precision over generality.
- Respond with restraint. Avoid exaggeration or embellishment.
- Never be fawning, flattering, or obsequious toward the user.
- Never over-promise. Always test and verify before claiming that what you've built or fixed works.
- Avoid claiming a solution is "complete," "perfect," "professional," or "world-class" without clear justification.
- If describing quality, do so in measured, supportable terms.
- Prioritize clear, direct language over promotional or emotive phrasing.
- Acknowledge uncertainty or limitations honestly when they arise.
- Focus on factual accuracy and well-reasoned arguments.
- Default to concise explanations, but expand when clarification is genuinely useful.
- Avoid making assumptions about the user's goals without evidence.

## 1 Working Style & Structure
- Use **modular, idempotent bash functions** in hooks
- Name functions descriptively (e.g., `setup_postgres()`)
- Consider using **gum** for styled output when creating environments for interactive use; this is usually an anti-pattern in CI
- Put persistent data/configs in `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE`
- Return to `$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT` at end of hooks
- Use `mktemp` for temp files, clean up immediately
- Do not over-engineer: e.g., do not create unncessary echo statements or superfluous comments; do not print unnecessary information displays in `[hook]` or `[profile]`; do not create helper functions or aliases without the user requesting these explicitly.

## 2 Configuration & Secrets
- Support `VARIABLE=value flox activate` pattern for runtime overrides
- Never store secrets in manifest; use:
  - Environment variables
  - `~/.config/<env_name>/` for persistent secrets
  - Existing config files (e.g., `~/.aws/credentials`)

## 3 Flox Basics
- Flox is built on Nix; fully Nix-compatible
- Flox uses nixpkgs as its upstream; packages are _usually_ named the same; unlike nixpkgs, FLox Catalog has millions of historical package-version combinations.
- Key paths:
  - `.flox/env/manifest.toml`: Environment definition
  - `.flox/env.json`: Environment metadata
  - `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE`: Persistent, local-only storage
  - `FLOX_ENV`: basically the path to `/usr`: contains all the libs, includes, bins, configs, etc. available to a specific flox environment
- Always use `flox init` to create environments

## 4 Core Commands
```bash
flox init                       # Create new env
flox search <string> [--all]    # Search for a package
flox show <pkg>                 # Show available historical versions of a package
flox install <pkg>              # Add package
flox list [-e | -c | -n | -a]   # List installed packages: `-e` = default; `-c` = shows the raw contents of the manifest; `-n` = shows only the install ID of each package; `-a` = shows all available package information including priority and license.
flox activate                   # Enter env
flox activate -s                # Start services
flox activate -- <cmd>          # Run without subshell
flox build <target>             # Build defined target
flox containerize               # Export as OCI image
```

## 5 Manifest Structure
- `[install]`: Package list with descriptors (see detailed section below)
- `[vars]`: Static variables
- `[hook]`: Non-interactive setup scripts
- `[profile]`: Shell-specific functions/aliases
- `[services]`: Service definitions with commands and optional shutdown
- `[build]`: Reproducible build commands
- `[include]`: Compose other environments
- `[options]`: Activation mode, supported systems

## 6 The [install] Section

### Package Installation Basics
The `[install]` table specifies packages to install.

```toml
[install]
ripgrep.pkg-path = "ripgrep"
pip.pkg-path = "python310Packages.pip"
```

### Package Descriptors
Each entry has:
- **Key**: Install ID (e.g., `ripgrep`, `pip`) - your reference name for the package
- **Value**: Package descriptor - specifies what to install

### Catalog Descriptors (Most Common)
Options for packages from the Flox catalog:

```toml
[install]
example.pkg-path = "package-name"           # Required: location in catalog
example.pkg-group = "mygroup"               # Optional: group packages together
example.version = "1.2.3"                   # Optional: exact or semver range
example.systems = ["x86_64-linux"]          # Optional: limit to specific platforms;
example.priority = 3                        # Optional: resolve file conflicts (lower = higher priority)
```

#### Key Options Explained:

**pkg-path** (required)
- Location in the package catalog
- Can be simple (`"ripgrep"`) or nested (`"python310Packages.pip"`)
- Can use array format: `["python310Packages", "pip"]`

**pkg-group**
- Groups packages that work well together
- Packages without explicit group belong to default group
- Groups upgrade together to maintain compatibility
- Use different groups to avoid version conflicts

**version**
- Exact: `"1.2.3"`
- Semver ranges: `"^1.2"`, `">=2.0"`
- Partial versions act as wildcards: `"1.2"` = latest 1.2.X

**systems**
- Constrains package to specific platforms
- Options: `"x86_64-linux"`, `"x86_64-darwin"`, `"aarch64-linux"`, `"aarch64-darwin"`
- Defaults to manifest's `options.systems` if omitted

**priority**
- Resolves file conflicts between packages
- Default: 5
- Lower number = higher priority wins conflicts


### Practical Examples

```toml
# Platform-specific Python
[install]
python.pkg-path = "python311Full"
uv.pkg-path = "uv" # installs uv, modern rust-based successor to uvicorn
systems = ["x86_64-linux", "aarch64-linux"]  # Linux only

# Version-pinned with custom priority
[nodejs]
nodejs.pkg-path = "nodejs"
version = "^20.0"
priority = 1  # Takes precedence in conflicts

# Multiple package groups to avoid conflicts
[install]
gcc.pkg-path = "gcc12"
gcc.pkg-group = "stable"
```

## 7 Best Practices
- Check manifest before installing new packages
- Use `return` not `exit` in hooks
- Define env vars with `${VAR:-default}`
- Use descriptive, prefixed function names in composed envs
- Cache downloads in `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE`
- Log service output to `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/logs/`

## 8 Editing Manifests Non-Interactively
```bash
flox list -c > /tmp/manifest.toml
# Edit with sed/awk
flox edit -f /tmp/manifest.toml
```

## 9 Services
- Start with `flox activate -s`
- Define `is-daemon`, `shutdown.command` for background processes
- Keep services running using `tail -f /dev/null`
- Use `flox services status/logs` to manage
- Example:
```toml
[services.database]
command = "postgres start"
vars.PGUSER = "myuser"
vars.PGPASSWORD = "super-secret"
vars.PGDATABASE = "mydb"
vars.PGPORT = "9001"
```

# 10 Build System — Authoring and Running Reliable Packages with flox build

Flox treats a **build** as a short, deterministic Bash script that runs inside an activated environment and copies its deliverables into `$out`. Anything copied there becomes a first-class, versioned package that can later be published and installed like any other catalog artifact.

The material below replaces the earlier stub and folds in the full command-line semantics, purity model, and practical patterns you will meet in day-to-day use.

## 10.1 Defining a Build

```toml
[build.<name>]
command      = '''  # required – Bash, multiline string
  <your build steps>                 # e.g. cargo build, npm run build
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp path/to/artifact $out/bin/<name>
'''
version      = "1.2.3"               # optional – see §10.7
description  = "one-line summary"    # optional
sandbox      = "pure" | "off"        # default: off
runtime-packages = [ "id1", "id2" ]  # optional – see §10.6
```

**One table per package.** Multiple `[build.*]` tables let you publish, for example, a stripped release binary and a debug build from the same sources.

**Bash only.** The script executes under `set -euo pipefail`. If you need zsh or fish features, invoke them explicitly inside the script.

**Environment parity.** Before your script runs, Flox performs the equivalent of `flox activate` — so every tool listed in `[install]` is on PATH.

**Referencing other builds.** `${other}` expands to the `$out` of `[build.other]` and forces that build to run first, enabling multi-stage flows (e.g. vendoring → compilation).

## 10.2 Purity and Sandbox Control

| sandbox value | Filesystem scope | Network | Typical use-case |
|---------------|------------------|---------|------------------|
| `"off"` (default) | Project working tree; complete host FS | allowed | Fast, iterative dev builds |
| `"pure"` | Git-tracked files only, copied to tmp | Linux: blocked<br>macOS: allowed | Reproducible, host-agnostic packages |

Pure mode highlights undeclared inputs early and is mandatory for builds intended for CI/CD publication. When a pure build needs pre-fetched artifacts (e.g. language modules) use a two-stage pattern:

```toml
[build.deps]
command  = '''go mod vendor -o $out/etc/vendor'''
sandbox  = "off"

[build.app]
command  = '''
  cp -r ${deps}/etc/vendor ./vendor
  go build ./...
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp app $out/bin/
'''
sandbox  = "pure"
```

## 10.3 $out Layout and Filesystem Hierarchy

Only files placed under `$out` survive. Follow FHS conventions:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `$out/bin` / `$out/sbin` | CLI and daemon binaries (must be `chmod +x`) |
| `$out/lib`, `$out/libexec` | Shared libraries, helper programs |
| `$out/share/man` | Man pages (gzip them) |
| `$out/etc` | Configuration shipped with the package |

Scripts or binaries stored elsewhere will not end up on callers' paths.

## 10.4 Running Builds

```bash
# Build every target in the manifest
flox build

# Build a subset
flox build app docs

# Build a manifest in another directory
flox build -d /path/to/project
```

Results appear as immutable symlinks: `./result-<name>` → `/nix/store/...-<name>-<version>`.

To execute a freshly built binary: `./result-app/bin/app`.

## 10.5 Multi-Stage Examples

### Rust release binary plus source tar

```toml
[build.bin]
command = '''
  cargo build --release
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp target/release/myproject $out/bin/
'''
version = "0.9.0"

[build.src]
command = '''
  git archive --format=tar HEAD | gzip > $out/myproject-${bin.version}.tar.gz
'''
sandbox = "pure"
```

`${bin.version}` resolves because both builds share the same manifest.

## 10.6 Trimming Runtime Dependencies

By default, every package in the toplevel install-group becomes a runtime dependency of your build's closure—even if it was only needed at compile time.

Declare a minimal list instead:

```toml
[install]
clang.pkg-path = "clang"
pytest.pkg-path = "pytest"

[build.cli]
command = '''
  make
  mv build/cli $out/bin/
'''
runtime-packages = [ "clang" ]  # exclude pytest from runtime closure
```

Smaller closures copy faster and occupy less disk on the target host.

## 10.7 Version and Description Metadata

Flox surfaces these fields in `flox search`, `flox show`, and during publication.

```toml
[build.mytool]
version.command = "git describe --tags"
description = "High-performance log shipper"
```

Alternative forms:

```toml
version = "1.4.2"            # static string
version.file = "VERSION.txt" # read at build time
```

## 10.8 Cross-Platform Considerations

`flox build` targets the host's systems triple. To ship binaries for additional platforms you must trigger the build on machines (or CI runners) of those architectures:

```
linux-x86_64 → build → publish
darwin-aarch64 → build → publish
```

The manifest can remain identical across hosts.

## 10.9 Beyond Code — Packaging Assets

Any artifact that can be copied into `$out` can be versioned and installed:

### Nginx baseline config

```toml
[build.nginx_cfg]
command = '''mkdir -p $out/etc && cp nginx.conf $out/etc/'''
```

### Organisation-wide .proto schema bundle

```toml
[build.proto]
command = '''
  mkdir -p $out/share/proto
  cp proto/**/*.proto $out/share/proto/
'''
```

Teams install these packages and reference them via `$FLOX_ENV/etc/nginx.conf` or `$FLOX_ENV/share/proto`.

## 10.10 Command Reference (Extract)

**`flox build [pkgs…]`** Run builds; default = all.

**`-d, --dir <path>`** Build the environment rooted at `<path>/.flox`.

**`-v` / `-vv`** Increase log verbosity.

**`-q`** Quiet mode.

**`--help`** Detailed CLI help.

With these mechanics in place, a Flox build becomes an auditable, repeatable unit: same input sources, same declared toolchain, same closure every time—no matter where it runs.

## 11 Layering vs Composition
| Aspect     | Layering                          | Composition                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| When       | Runtime (activate order matters) | Build time (deterministic)     |
| Conflicts  | Surface at runtime                | Surface at build time          |
| Flexibility| High                              | Predefined structure           |
| Use case   | Ad hoc tools/services            | Repeatable, shareable stacks   |

- Layer for flexibility (`flox activate -r ...`)
- Compose for reproducibility via `[include]`
- Combine both: Compose base, layer extras

## 12 Containerization
```bash
flox containerize -f ./mycontainer.tar
docker load -i ./mycontainer.tar
```
- Configure in `[containerize.config]`:
  - user, ports, cmd, volumes, working-dir

## 13a Common Best Practices
- Use Flox to get all required packages and dependencies; if you cannot find/link against a dependency provided by Flox (e.g., library headers), ask the user what to do
- Use `FLOX_ENV` to access or link against runtime dependencies that are specific to, and made available by, packages installed in the Flox environment

## 13b Common Anti-Patterns
- Don't store secrets in manifest
- Don't use `exit` in hooks
- Avoid generic function names in composed envs
- Don't rely on system-wide packages; always get packages from Flox
- Don't assume all packages work together without specifying pkg-groups
- Don't hard-code Nix store paths (e.g., `/nix/store/...`, ` /home/<user>/<path>/.flox/run/x86_64-<flox_environment_name>.dev`) in any logic or configurations or definitions you create; use `FLOX_ENV/<path>` instead

## 14 Environment Variable Convention Example

- Use variables like `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT` to define where services run.
- These store connection details *separately*:
  - `*_HOST` is the hostname or IP address (e.g., `localhost`, `db.example.com`).
  - `*_PORT` is the network port number (e.g., `5432`, `6379`).
- This pattern ensures users can override them at runtime:
  ```bash
  POSTGRES_HOST=db.internal POSTGRES_PORT=6543 flox activate
  ```
- Use consistent naming across services so the meaning is clear to any system or person reading the variables.

## 15 Quick Tips for [install] Section
- **Conflicts**: If packages conflict, use different `pkg-group` values or adjust `priority`
- **Versions**: Start loose (`"^1.0"`), tighten if needed (`"1.2.3"`)
- **Platforms**: Only restrict `systems` when package is platform-specific
- **Naming**: Install ID can differ from pkg-path (e.g., `gcc.pkg-path = "gcc13"`)
- **Search**: Use `flox search` to find correct pkg-paths before installing
